# Garfield Downloader
This downloader was originally created by fbrozovic. It is outdated since garfield.com updated their comic database location but because the script works really well, i decided to update it.

# How to use the downloader
You need to have Python installed. I don't know if you need bs4 but if you do, be sure to install by typing `pip install beautifulsoup4`. Once you're set up, cd to the directory of the script in command prompt and type `python garfield-downloader.py` to activate the script.

# U.S. Acres version
The U.S. Acres version is fundamentally the same code, except for minor changes, so it works the same. However the strips from May 1st-May 6th 1989 are not on the database, and thus it reports them as a non-existant file.

Again, all credit to fbrozovic for the code.
