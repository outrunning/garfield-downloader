# garfield-downloader

This downloader was originally created by fbrozovic. It is outdated since garfield.com updated their comic database location but because the script works really well, i decided to update it.

Type in 'python garfield-downloader.py' in command prompt to activate it.

Again, all credit to fbrozovic.
